Every week, we pick the most notable apps, hardware, podcasts or what ever else we've encountered and think you should know of. This post will also be updated regularly throughout the week as we find more amazing stuff. So check back every now and then to learn about our latest findings.

We'd also like to know your opinions about our picks and/or your picks this week. Please leave a comment below to chime in.


## Picks
### [Blue Microphones: Nessie](http://www.bluemic.com/nessie/ "Nessie Microphone") (Patrice)

![Blue Microphones: Nessie][nessie]

Whether you're recording a podcast, narrating a video or talking to people over Skype: a good microphone is an essential tool for every business. Clean, balanced audio just sounds so much more professional than when you're sounding like you're recording in your bathroom. 

It doesn't have to be an expensive, full-fledged studio microphone, though. Blue Microphones provides a really good range of microphones for almost every use-case and price-point.  
Today's pick, the Nessie, has been my favorite podcasting microphone for over a year. It's named after the infamous Loch Ness monster, Nessie, whose shape it also resembles. The sound quality is more than adequate to record a podcast or screencast. It surely won't satisfy the audiophiles and professional audio engineers out there, but for us normal people who won't be recording Madonna any time soon, it is a good choice. The Nessie provides a zero-latency headphone output, a sturdy base, a mute button (which can be a little bit too sensitive at times), an integrated pop filter and an adjustable head. It's also Mac and PC compatible and can be connected to an iPad (with the help of an additional adapter, sold by Apple).

The Nessie is available [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-NESSIE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00BUIA362/?tag=infophreak-20 "Nessie on Amazon").

### [Sound Bunny](http://www.prosofteng.com/products/soundbunny.php "Sound Bunny by Prosoft") (Doc)

One of the longest standing irritations of Mac OS for many of us is the inability have control the volume for app individually.  We all have at least once been shaken from our chairs by some site with auto-play media that loads in a background tab and have had to hunt down the page that was playing some awful commercial or weird music. I recently had this happen during a Keynote presentation with an pretty sizable audience. I set out on a search to find a way to solve this when I happen upon [Sound Bunny](http://www.prosofteng.com/products/soundbunny.php "Sound Bunny by Prosoft")
