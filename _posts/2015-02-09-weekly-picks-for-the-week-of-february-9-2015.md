<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vb3F" title="Authy for iOS">Authy</a></h3>

<a href="http://macuser.pro/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/authy.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-309" src="http://macuser.pro/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/authy.jpeg" alt="http://macuser.pro/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/authy.jpeg" width="320" height="568" /></a>

<a href="https://www.authy.com/what-is-two-factor-authentication" title="What is Two-factor authentication">Two-factor (or two-step) authentication</a> has become more and more prevalent in the past few years. It's essentially the idea to add another step (and another device/channel) to the existing username &amp; password login system we all know and use, in order to make it more secure and less prone to hacking attempts. That additional step can be a text message you receive on your phone, a hardware-dongle that shows you random numbers or an app on your smartphone that shows those same numbers in a much nicer package.

That's where <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vb3F" title="Authy for iOS">Authy</a> comes in handy. It uses Google's authentication system (the system most services use nowadays) to generate those 6 digits numbers that renew every couple of seconds.

What's nice about this app, and what makes it better than Google's app, is the fact that it not only works on both your iPad and iPhone, but also syncs between them. Granted, not everybody will like that (because of the inherent security issues), but it's convenient as hell. And <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vb3F" title="Authy for iOS">Authy</a> promises, that everything is encrypted and secure.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vb3F" title="Authy for iOS">Authy</a> also offers an API and a WordPress plugin, so if you want to add two-factor authentication to your app or website, you should check that out.

There are times when you have to take into account how much something will cost to be repaired and how much time you are willing to spend on it to get it repaired. During my time as a technician, I have seen everything from a bent laptop casings to a crushed / melted iPhones. In these extreme cases, it is usually cheaper to purchase a new device or try to have it repaired by Apple. In most other cases and if the malfunction is not covered under warranty, many things will be simple fixes that save you both time and money. Just like most people should be able to change a flat tire or replace their oil, a professional Mac / iOS user should be able to perform those simple repairs themselves (or guide a fellow co-worker / employee to the correct resources so they can knock out the repair).

My favorite site for guides on how to repair both iOS and Mac devices has to be <a href="https://www.ifixit.com" title="ifixit.com website">iFixit.com</a>. They not only have great guides with step-by-step walkthroughs and detailed photos, they also carry the tools and the parts that you need to complete the repair of your broken Apple gear. They recently released some great <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifixit-repair-manual/id407417097?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY" title="ifixit.com ipad app">iPad</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifixit-repair-manual/id407417097?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY" title="ifixit.com iPhone app">iPhone</a> applications that allow you to view the manuals on the go. I know the focus is supposed to be on Apple products, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com" title="ifixit.com website">iFixit</a> also has manuals for everything from bicycle to miscellaneous electronics repairs. For an up and coming professional who likes to get their hands dirty (and save some money in the process), these manuals can be lifesavers...just as they have been for me! Best of all, access to these manuals is FREE so, if you utilize the manuals, I would recommend purchasing something from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com" title="ifixit.com website">iFixit</a> to support this great service!
