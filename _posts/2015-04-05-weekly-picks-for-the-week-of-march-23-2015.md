### [Wordpress iOS Application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id335703880 "wordpress iOS application link")
<a href="http://macuser.pro/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress.jpeg"><img src="http://macuser.pro/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-300x300.jpeg" alt="wordpress" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-627" /></a>

As more and more users flock to content management systems like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org "wordpress.org site") (I personally utilize this CMS for my art business’s storefront), more and more business professionals need to update their blogs on the go.  You might have an important event that needs to be publicized as soon as possible or you want to take advantage of some down time to update the information on your site.  At first, the [Wordpress mobile application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id335703880 "wordpress iOS application link") wasn’t that great due to a lack of features and stability so I only used it for.  It has come a long way, though, and now I don’t know how I was updating my blog without the application.  The universal [WordPress mobile application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id335703880 "wordpress mobile application iOS link") runs great on both your iPad and iPhone and allows you to manage multiple sites’ comments and blog posts, check on a site’s statistics via [JetPack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/ "link to the wordpress jetpack plugin"), and easily access the admin module if required to make changes that are not available in the application itself.  For users of [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword "link to the agilebits 1password homepage"), the [WordPress mobile application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id335703880 "wordpress mobile application iOS link") integrates 1Password for easy vault access.  Best of all, this application is free download making it a great bargain.  Happy posting!
