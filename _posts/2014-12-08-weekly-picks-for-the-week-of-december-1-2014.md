### [Caffeine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12&uo=4&at=1l3vb3F)

Most Macs nowadays turn of the screen and go to sleep after a certain period of time. And while that's the way you might want it to be for the most part, there are those times where you just want it to be on all the time.  
For me that is the case, when I'm recording a video on my MacBook Pro. I don't want to change the settings I normally use, but the Mac has to be awake so I can see the recording while I'm running the show. That's when I use Caffeine.

Caffeine, as the name suggests, keeps you make awake. That's it. No bells or whistles, just a single purpose app (although it has a few additional settings like just keeping your Mac awake for a particular duration).
