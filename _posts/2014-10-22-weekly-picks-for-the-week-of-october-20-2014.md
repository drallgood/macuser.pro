Every week, we pick the most notable apps, hardware, podcasts or whatever else we encounter and think you should know about. This post will also be updated regularly throughout the week as we find more amazing stuff. So check back every now and then to learn about our latest findings.

We'd also like to know your opinions about our picks and/or your picks this week. Please leave a comment below to chime in.

## Picks
### [Reflective Backpack: Rickshaw Bagworks](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/markdwight/amazing-reflective-backpack-by-rickshaw-bagworks) (Patrice)

I have to be honest with you: I'm a Rickshaw addict. So are many of my friends, including everybody at the Professional Apple Users Academy. I own several Rickshaw bags and am insanely in love with each and every one of them. Back in March, I was even able to visit Rickshaw's factory in San Francisco, something I'd compare to visiting 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino (or so I've heard).

This is why I got really excited when Rickshaw's owner Mark Dwight announced a new Kickstarter project promising us new, reflective bags. Rickshaw is constantly searching for new, better fabrics and ideas for their products. Last year they found a new reflective yarn and dreamt up a new series of bags that not only look awesome by day but also protect you by night. No more living in fear of being run over by a car while riding around on your bike at night.  
The yarn itself is relatively expensive and hard to weave, so naturally the bags are rather expensive compared to their counterparts made of "normal" fabrics. However, there is a chance to get your hands on the first batch of bags for a lower price by supporting the Kickstarter campaign. You'll have to be quick though: the campaign ends on October 25, 2014. 

(Oh and if someone wants to order one for me, he/she would make me really happy. Ordering anything in the US is freaking expensive when you're living in Europe...)

###[Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) (Jerome)

The [Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) messaging application has become very popular in countries outside US and is also starting to gain traction in the US.  

![Line][line]

If you have a business that has to communicate with people in the East, the [Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) app is almost ubiquitous in use.  Many of my friends and contacts in Japan use Line, and in fact it is their preferred way of communicating.  As with most all communication applications, [Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY)  exists not only on iOS, but also on many other platforms (Android, the Mac, Windows).  Line even allows for switching between video or voice communication when needed.  Bottom line:  Next to the Messages app, Line takes second place with the amount of messages it sends and receives.  Best of all, the application and service are free.  [Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) makes money by releasing games and selling stickers, themes, etc that tie into their platform.  To use the plain old application, you do not have to spend a penny!  

### [Cocoon Grid-It](http://www.cocooninnovations.com/cat_info.php) (Kelly)

![Gridit][gridit]

Cocoon Innovations makes a organizational products, most notably the Grid-It, various strips of elastic (with rubber in them) woven together on a flat surface. You can tuck all your gear into the weave, and keep it organized. There are different sizes available, I have the 8" x 12" Grid-It, and I adore it. I carry a variety of bits and pieces in my bag constantly, and after going through a variety of pouches and small bags and all sorts of other storage solutions I discovered the Grid-It and I couldn't be happier. Thanks to the straps, everything stays flat and cables don't tangle. You can see everything you have at a glance, and since the straps are various sizes and woven in different ways you have smaller loops and larger loops to tuck gear into, making everything secure. You can get just the Grid-It, or you can get a tech sleeve that holds your iPad or laptop as well, or even a messenger bag or backpack with a built-in Grid-It panel. I have carried all sorts of things in my Grid-It, from my laptop power brick to extra SD cards, and everything stays together.
