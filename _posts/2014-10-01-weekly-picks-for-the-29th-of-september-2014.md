Every week, we pick the most notable apps, hardware, podcasts or what ever else we've encountered and think you should know of. This post will also be updated regularly throughout the week as we find more amazing stuff. So check back every now and then to learn about our latest findings.

We'd also like to know your opinions about our picks and/or your picks this week. Please leave a comment below to chime in.

## Picks
### [Deliveries by Junecloud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) (Jerome)

![Deliveries App][deliveries]

I have a need to track a lot of deliveries that are incoming and outbound and needed an application to consolidate tracking information for all of the different services, that are utilized by my business and by the likes of Amazon, Apple, etc.  My go-to app to keep track of all the deliveries is the aptly named [Deliveries](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) by Junecloud.  I am able to enter my tracking numbers and it automatically detects the service via the number I entered.  There is also a [widget](http://junecloud.com/software/mac/delivery-status.html) available for free where you use Junecloudâ€™s free sync service to sync the information between devices.  

All in all, [Deliveries](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v3UY) is a well designed app that does one thing very well:  track my deliveries!


### [Slack](https://slack.com/r/02m97853-02mmb41t) (Patrice)

There's certainly no lack of tools for team communication out there: Skype, IRC, Basecamp, the good old email, or even Twitter.   
Recently I was on the lookout for a new tool. I had three basic requirements for such a tool:

- it had to be usable on iOS and OS X (ideally with a native app)
- it needed to archive the communication so I could reference/search for particular items later on



A few people had talked about [Slack](https://slack.com/r/02m97853-02mmb41t) and how they used it for their projects, so naturally I jumped on the opportunity of giving it a try. I almost instantly fell in love with it, and so did my team mates.

![Slack app on OS X][slack]

Using it is pretty simple: initially it looks and behaves like any chat client. It uses channels to separate different topics or areas of responsibility. You can even talk to people directly or create private groups to keep certain information secret.  
Only after a few hours of using it you start to discover the real power of [Slack](https://slack.com/r/02m97853-02mmb41t). Advanced features like posts, files, snippets get out of the way when you don't need them. [Slack](https://slack.com/r/02m97853-02mmb41t) also integrates with a myriad of services (Dropbox, Twitter, ...) so you can basically use it as a main command center for your business. 

Stay tuned for a more in-depth review of [Slack](https://slack.com/r/02m97853-02mmb41t) in the future.
