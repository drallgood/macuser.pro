Your iOS device is the quickly becoming the digital hub of your business.  Communication, business applications, access to the cloud, locally stored files...these are only a small set of roles that your device now performs for you.  Having a catastrophic hardware or software failure, losing your device, or even theft can put a crimp into your business plans if you do not have your data secured. This article will I go into a high level overview of how to backup your information and provides a few techniques to keep that data safe.

One recommendation I would like to share before backing up:  Remove anything that is not necessary from you phone to streamline the backup.  For example, here are a few items I would remove before backing up:

1. Applications that have not been used for more than 6 months.
2. Pictures that have been moved to your computer and backed up.
3. Videos that have been moved to your computer and backed up.

## Backing Up Via iTunes

If you connect your phone to your computer on a daily basis, it is possible to utilize iTunes as your backup solution.  Compared to iCloud, the backup will be available locally and can be backed up via Time Machine or another application. If you primarily are on the go or rarely hook your phone to your computer, utilizing iCloud Backup will be a better solution.  

1. Attach your iOS device to your computer via the lightning cable.
2. Open up the iTunes application.
3. Click on File, then Devices, then Back up.
4. Next, click on iTunes dropdown and choose Preferences.
5. Click on Devices in your Preferences window.
6. Verify that your backup is present.
7. Congratulations, you have successfully backed up your iOS device!

## Backing Up via iCloud

If you prefer your backups on the go or are never near your computer to back up your iOS device on a daily basis, it is a good idea to rely on iCloud.  The iCloud backup will continuously run in the background, when you are connected to a wifi network (and to a charger), and saves your device's settings, a list of installed apps, photos, etc to Apple's iCloud.  Depending on how much information is contained within your iOS device, you might have to spring for a larger tier of iCloud storage if the free 5 gigabyte is not enough.  Follow the steps below to set up your iCloud backup (If this is a new device that has not been associated with an iCloud account, you will be prompted to set up a free iCloud account during the initial setup).  

1. Make sure that your iOS device is connected to a wireless network and that you have already created a free iCloud account.
2. Tap on your Settings application.
3. Scroll down to the iCloud tab in the Settings Application and tap on it.
4. Tap on Storage & Backup.
5. Make sure iCloud Backup is turned on.
6. Tap on Back Up Now.
7. Await the completion of the backup.
8. After completion of the backup, the time of the last backup will be displayed.
9. Congratulations, you have successfully backed up your iOS device!

### Third Party Backup Solutions

Even if you use the previously mentioned backup solutions, more granular control might be needed that isn't offered via Apple's first party solutions.  With the recent update to version 8.3 of iOS, some of these third party solutions might not function as Apple fixed security holes that these applications were using to gain access to your data.  Always check the developer's site your version of iOS is supported and USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Ecamm's [PhoneView](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ "PhoneView") application is an option if you want to back up your text messages, voicemail, notes, etc.  An easy to use interface makes this another great option if you want to back up specific items from your iOS device.  

[iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/ "iExplorer") is another great application that allows you to back up items on a more granular level.  iExplorer gives you the option to back up the specific messages, contacts, enables you to mount your phone on your Mac and save those high scores and saved games.  This application is very powerful and costs $34.99.  

### Back it Up (and do it again)
As you can see, backing up your iOS device is a simple procedure and it will keep you from having heartaches and massive data recovery bills later down the road (you should not only be backing up when a new version of iOS comes out).  If you do have issues, you can always book a Genius Bar appointment at Apple and have them assist you (or feel free to email us and we can try to figure out a solution)!
